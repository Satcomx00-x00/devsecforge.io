## What is SAST?

Static Application Security Testing (SAST) analyzes source code, bytecode, or binaries for security vulnerabilities without executing the program.

## Key Benefits

- **Early Detection**: Find vulnerabilities during development
- **Fast Feedback**: Immediate results in your IDE or CI/CD
- **Code Coverage**: Analyze 100% of your codebase
- **Compliance**: Meet security standards and regulations

## Popular SAST Tools

### Open Source

```package-install
semgrep
```

**Semgrep** - Fast, lightweight static analysis
- Language support: 30+ languages
- Custom rule creation
- CI/CD integration

```bash
# Run Semgrep scan
semgrep --config=auto .
```

### Commercial Tools

| Tool | Languages | Best For |
|------|-----------|----------|
| Checkmarx | 25+ | Enterprise |
| Veracode | 20+ | Compliance |
| Snyk Code | 10+ | Developer-first |
| SonarQube | 30+ | Code quality + security |

## Integration Example (GitHub Actions)

```yaml
name: SAST Scan

on:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  sast:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - name: Run Semgrep
        uses: returntocorp/semgrep-action@v1
        with:
          config: >-
            p/security-audit
            p/secrets
            p/owasp-top-ten
          
      - name: Upload SARIF results
        uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v3
        if: always()
        with:
          sarif_file: semgrep.sarif
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Run Early and Often

```bash
# Pre-commit hook
#!/bin/bash
semgrep --config=auto --error --quiet .
```

### 2. Configure for Your Stack

```yaml
# .semgrep.yml
rules:
  - id: sql-injection
    pattern: |
      db.execute($QUERY)
    message: Potential SQL injection
    severity: ERROR
    languages: [python]
```

### 3. Triage Effectively

<Callout type="warn">
Not all findings are equal. Prioritize based on:
- **Severity**: Critical > High > Medium > Low
- **Exploitability**: Easy to exploit vulnerabilities first
- **Context**: Business impact and data sensitivity
</Callout>

## Common Vulnerabilities Detected

- SQL Injection
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Command Injection
- Path Traversal
- Hardcoded Secrets
- Insecure Cryptography
- Authentication Issues
- Authorization Bypasses

## SAST Limitations

<Callout type="info">
SAST cannot detect:
- Runtime vulnerabilities
- Configuration issues
- Third-party service vulnerabilities
- Business logic flaws

Combine with DAST and other security testing methods.
</Callout>
