## Security Shift-Left

Integrating security early in the development process helps:

- **Reduce costs**: Finding vulnerabilities early is cheaper to fix
- **Improve quality**: Better code security from the start
- **Increase speed**: Fewer security issues to resolve later
- **Build trust**: Demonstrate security commitment to customers

## Getting Started

Start with [SAST](/docs/security/sast) to integrate static analysis into your workflow, then expand to other security practices.
